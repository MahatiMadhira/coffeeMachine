# Coffee Machine
Python code to replicate the function of a coffee machine that makes 3 different drinks (espresso/latte/cappuccino). 
It creates a report of existing ingredients and cannot make a drink if sufficient ingredients aren't there or enough money isn't given by the customer.
If the customer provides more money than needed to make the drink, the drink cost is added to profit, and change is calculated and returned to the customer.
